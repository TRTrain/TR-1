# Hi 👋
I'm Train. I've learned more about myself as a person who is passionate about data analytics and a knowledgeable person in the business logic for any business domain, one of which is the person who is able to understand and consult users as a consultant and find insights to apply and analyzing a company’s business. All of this is a fulfillment of my goals and is essential for me to lead my working life.

Currently, I'm open to opportunities in roles such as Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Front-End Developer.
